	<h2>Cities I've Lived In</h2>
	<p>I was born in Managua Nicaragua. When I was about 2 I moved to Lafayette Co. From their at the age of 13 I moved with my mom to Pico Rivera. I soon came back to Lafayette with my dad. The other moves are from moving around with my mom and brother. I just recently moved into my own apartment in Westminster.</p>
